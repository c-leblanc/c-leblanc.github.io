I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the UC3M (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid) within the [EnergyEcoLab](https://energyecolab.uc3m.es/) team.
My research focus is on electricity production, electricity consumption and electricity markets.
My PhD thesis, which I defended in June 2023 at the ENPC (Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, Paris), is entitled "Microeconomic Analysis of Subsisdy Mechanisms for Electricity Generation from Wind and Solar sources".
